MiGestureControl was an annual media informatics project at the Harz University of Applied Sciences. The aim of the project was to control devices such as lamps by gestures. The result was a Java application that can recognize gestures by means of a Microsoft Kinect. For example, it is possible to select one device by pointing at it and switch it on by lifting the other arm. The application uses the Akka Framework and has a high fault tolerance and reliability.
