The German Institute for Food Technology (Deutsches Institut f√ºr Lebensmitteltechnik e. V.) (DIL) works - supported by around 150 member companies from the food industry and related areas - as a research institute in product and process development and analytics.

In order to keep the members of the institute up to date with the latest mobile information, an iPhone and iPad app was developed which makes the most important information easily accessible and optimized for the respective device. Special attention was paid to a simple design, which makes navigation easier with an easy-to-understand colour scheme.
