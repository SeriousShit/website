The project aims at the development of an interactive e-learning module for the initial and further training of teachers of religious education in vocational schools (BRU).

With the help of the videographic module, the competences of religious education can be perceived by trainees and young adults and necessary professional references can be developed in a differentiated way. The underlying criteria were developed by bibor and PTI (Dr√ºbeck).
