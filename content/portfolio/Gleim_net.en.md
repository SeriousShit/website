The Gleimhaus is one of the oldest German literary museums, set up in 1862 in the former home of the poet and collector Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim (1719-1803) at the Halberstadt Cathedral.

Gleim. net is a social network developed for the Museum Gleimhaus in Halberstadt. In this social network, pupils are taught media literacy as well as the historical context of the time of Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim.
